Author: Zhao Yang (zhaoyang8778@gmail.com)

== Description ==

The code under this directory implements a 11 * 11 hex game which can be played 
between human and a very strong AI.

Hex is a strategy board game played on a hexagonal grid, theoretically of any size
and several possible shapes, but traditionally as an 11Ã—11 rhombus.

Each player has an allocated color, Red and Blue. Players take turns placing a 
stone of their color on a single cell within the overall playing board. The goal 
for each player is to form a connected path of their own stones linking the oppo-
-sing sides of the board marked by their colors, before their opponent connects 
his or her sides in a similar fashion. The first player to complete his or her 
connection wins the game.
